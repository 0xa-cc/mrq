A strong focus was put on the tools and particularly the dashboard. After all it is what you will work with most of the time!

#### How to run

To run the dashboard, make sur that mrq is properly installed. Then, use the
following command:

```bash
mrq-dashboard
```

The Dashboard will be available on the `5555` port (http://localhost:5555).

#### Main goal

There are too many features on the dashboard to list, but the goal is to have complete visibility and control over what your workers are doing!
